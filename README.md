üìñ Project Description
The Real Estate Management System is a full-stack web application developed with Python for the backend (using Flask or Django) and React for the frontend. The system allows users to view available properties for rent or sale, upload property details, and communicate with landlords or tenants via email. The application also supports uploading and displaying property images.

‚ú® Features
Property Listings: Landlords can list properties for rent or sale, including the ability to add details such as price, location, and property type.
Property Search: Users can search for properties based on various criteria like price range, location, and property type.
Email Notifications: The system automatically sends email notifications to both the landlord and tenant when a property is listed, rented, or purchased.
Property Images: Each property listing supports multiple images to provide a comprehensive view of the property.
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Responsive Design: The application is built to be mobile-friendly, so users can access it from their phones or tablets.
